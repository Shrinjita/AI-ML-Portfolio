## About

This repository is a showcase of various AI-based projects I have developed or experimented with, from generative models to language models, including TTS (Text-to-Speech), text summarization, chatbot development, and more. The projects utilize various frameworks and libraries like PyTorch, Hugging Face, and LangChain.

## Project List

1. **audiogen** - A project focused on generating audio using AI models.
2. **Behind the Pipeline (PyTorch)** - An exploration of PyTorch pipelines for various tasks.
3. **ChatGLM_Implementation** - Implementation of ChatGLM, an AI chatbot.
4. **DateChatBot+PptToTxt** - A project to extract text from PowerPoint presentations and use it in a chatbot context.
5. **dcgan_fashion_mnist** - A Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) implemented for generating images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
6. **Fine-tune Llama 2 in Google Colab** - A guide and project to fine-tune the LLaMA 2 model using Google Colab.
